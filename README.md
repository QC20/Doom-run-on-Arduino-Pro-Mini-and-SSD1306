## SSD1306 OLED Display

The SSD1306 OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) display is based on light-emitting diode (LED) technology, where the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound that emits light in response to an electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes, typically with at least one electrode being transparent.

OLEDs are extensively used to create digital displays in various devices such as television screens, computer monitors, portable systems like mobile phones, handheld game consoles, and PDAs. Notably, OLED displays do not require a backlight as they emit visible light themselves. This characteristic enables OLED displays to achieve deep black levels, making them thinner, lighter, and capable of offering a high contrast ratio compared to traditional liquid crystal displays (LCDs).
